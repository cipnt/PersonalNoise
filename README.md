This is a WordPress theme I created for my personal website in order to get myself used to adhere to WP best practices and also to become familiarised with the GitHub workflow in production.

If you like the design and/or implementation, feel free to fork or download this for your website.

Based on the _s starter theme by Automattic (http://underscores.me/)
